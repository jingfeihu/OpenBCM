===========
Release 2.6
===========

Release Date: July 12, 2019

FW loader version: v2.6
SerDes FW version: D102_0A

Devices supported in this release:
BCM56980 (Tomahawk3) family
BCM56870 (Trident3-X7) family
BCM56770 (Trident3-X5) family
BCM56370 (Trident3-X3) family
BCM56275 (Trident3-X2) family

Important Notes:
v2.6 firmware supports PCIe warm reset without causing iProc reset.
v2.6 firmware was validated with SDK 6.5.16 which implements PCIe hot swap sequencing code to ensure that there are no stale DMA transactions when the PCIe link went down. Customers who do not wish to enable hotswap support can disable it using switch control "bcmSwitchHotSwapDisable". Please refer to KM article # KB0028301 to understand SDK patches needed.

Upgrading to v2.6 firmware is only supported with coldboot. Warmboot and live upgrade are not supported.

Bug Fixes:
  FW Loader:
  - [SDK-159943] PCIe interface may not work in GEN3 speed after the switch is
                 reset by toggling SYS_RST_N and PCIE_PERST_N
  - [SDK-167844] PCIe G3 FW v2.5 ignores chip strap signals

Improvements:
  SerDes FW:
   - [M16_PCIEG3][Enhancement] Update to set optimal PLL BW settings in Gen1/Gen2 (PLPSERDES-1013)

  FW Loader:
  - [SDK-167408] Added Hotswap support
  - [SDK-165034] Better handling of PERST from Root Complex
  - [SDK-171130] Optimizations to handle Reset, PERST/Hotswap events better

Known Issues:
This release does not support BCM88790 (Ramon) and BCM88690 (Jericho2) devices. Updated support for these devices will be provided in an upcoming release.

===========
Release 2.2
===========
No external release


===========
Release 2.1
===========

Release Date: Nov 02, 2017

FW loader version: v2.1
SerDes FW version: D102_04

Devices supported in this release:
BCM56870_A0 family

Major Bug Fixes:
SDK-134560 PCIe FW loader should jump to penholder at the end
   In 2.0, FW loader parks at penholder location 0xffff0fe8 with WFE.
   However embedded apps expects R5 to be in a loop jumping to
   address pointed penholder location, SDK updates penholder with
   start address of embedded apps entry point. FW is modified to do so.
   Also, FW will check for FW load status at the very begining and brach
   accordingly, i.e loading of SerDes FW vs jumping to penholder.

Improvements:
None

Known Issues:
The penholder location currently points to TCM boot penholder. This FW loader
doesn't have support for penholder for other boot modes, QSPI/ROM etc.

===========
Release 2.0
===========

Release Date: Oct 25, 2017

FW loader version: v2.0
SerDes FW version: D102_04

Devices supported in this release:
BCM56870_A0 family

Major Bug Fixes:
SDK-134560 PCIe FW loader should jump to penholder at the end
   In previous versions, FW loader goes into an infinite loop after
   loading the SerDes FW, doesn't allow ARM R5-0 to boot any other
   application, e.g.,uKernel. This issues is fixed in this release,
   now R5-0 will park at penholder location 0xFFFF0FE8 which will allow
   application to write starting address at this penholder location and
   trigger SEV to run the application.

SDK-123375 Adding support for arbitrary SerDes register writes
   FW loader can now read {PHY addr, val} pairs from data blob at 0x10000
   offset, and writes given value to register with given address in the
   address/value pair.

SDK-132724 Enhancements to PLL bandwidth and peaking
    PLL bandwidth and peaking values are updated from dedfault to recommended
    values based on DVT

SDK-131047 Disable advertising Vital Product Data support

Improvements:
SDK-130877 Upgrade PCIe Gen3 SerDes Firmware to D102_04 version:
    Previous versions of the SerDes FW mandates micro reset after every
    PERST, hot-reset, hotswap event etc. This FW removes such requirement,
    stays intact during all resets except power on reset.

Known Issues:
The penholder location currently points to TCM boot penholder. This FW loader
doesn't have support for penholder for other boot modes, QSPI/ROM etc.
